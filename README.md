### For people who want to use the original version of Tranquilpeak without modifications (users)

Go to the directory where you have your Hugo site and run:

```shell
mkdir themes
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/Superjie13/hugo-tranquilpeak.git
```

After installing the Tranquilpeak theme successfully, we recommend you to take a look at the [exampleSite](exampleSite) directory. You will find a working Hugo site configured with the Tranquilpeak theme that you can use as a starting point for your site.

First, let's take a look at the [config.toml](exampleSite/config.toml). It will be useful to learn how to customize your site. Feel free to play around with the settings.
